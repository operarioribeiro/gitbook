> _"I was nicknamed 'Oper√°rio', which in Brazil meant a hopelessly poor 'Operator' worker. I got so hurt with all the unemployment hunger misery, throughout all sort of sub-employment and analogous to slavery jobs, that after decades of prayer and study I accepted it as a God sent mission for me to become an exemplary worker. That inspired me to become the internationally awarded 'Opera Composer' and cultural diplomacy humanitarian 'Operations Developer (DevOps)' I am today. I hope we can bring more workers to this mass we are all in for the common good."_
