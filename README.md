> _"I was nicknamed 'Operário', which in Brazil meant a hopelessly poor 'Operator' worker when I started working as an adolescent. I got so hurt with all the unemployment hunger misery, throughout all sort of sub-employment and analogous to slavery jobs, that after decades of prayer and study I accepted that nickname as a God sent mission for me to become an exemplary worker. That inspired me to become the internationally awarded 'Opera Composer' and cultural diplomacy humanitarian peacemaking 'Operations Developer (DevOps)' I am today. I hope we can bring more workers to this mass we are all in for the common good."_

## **Daily Routine**

**Leading a Simple Life**, with the help of [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) and [Cal.com](https://cal.com/operarioribeiro), he follows a disciplined teetotal abstemious vegetarian plentiful day to day schedule of prayer, relations care, studies, helping the Peace Church, assisting organizations, diplomatic events, composing sacred music operas, developing ecomuseological exhibits, creating solidarity-inspired arts, and updating this website with the help of his  network of volunteers, mainly offline. He and his team only accept projects invitations and curatorial requests in compliance with the nonviolent rule of law (RoL) humanitarian principles of his [open methodology](methodology.md).
